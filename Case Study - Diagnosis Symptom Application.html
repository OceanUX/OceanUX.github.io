                      <p>To effectively address user needs and minimise frustration, the information architecture (IA)
                        is organised into five key functions: symptom diagnosis, daily health tracking, medical
                        history
                        records, nearby healthcare services, and basic settings. Symptom diagnosis is positioned as
                        the
                        central and most essential feature, designed to enhance usability by categorising the human
                        body
                        into four regions, making symptom selection more intuitive and efficient.

                        an intuitive
                        and seamless user journey. Since symptom diagnosis is the core functionality, the user flow is
                        primarily centred around optimising this experience.

                        primary function — symptom diagnosis. This feature is structured as a five-step process:

                        experience confidently and without confusion. The interface adheres to established
                        accessibility
                        and usability principles by using plain language, ample white space, centralised content, and
                        informative visuals to support comprehension.
                      </p>
                      <p>The colour palette — white, grey, and blue — was chosen to convey a clean, professional, and
                        trustworthy medical tone. A secondary highlight colour, orange, inspired by NHS branding, is
                        used selectively to draw attention to key actions and important information.</p>

                        significant role in user comprehension than visual aids.

                      <p>As a result, the UI design should prioritise <b class="highlight">clear, straightforward

                      </h3>
                      <p>Given time constraints, the MVP focused solely on the core functionality — symptom diagnosis.
                      </p>
                      <p>As a UX/Product Designer rather than a professional software developer, I faced technical
                        limitations — most notably, the lack of a clinical database to power the diagnostic engine. I
                        initially explored using the NHS API, but access is restricted to authorised healthcare
                        systems.
                        As an alternative, I turned to Infermedica, an open-source API that provides a symptom
                        diagnosis
                        engine using Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
                      <p>What I learned from this experience:</p>

                        <li><b class="highlight">Understanding the Code Architecture</b><br>
                          The source code followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, requiring time to
                          learn
                          its structure and how it dynamically generates the HTML DOM using JavaScript.
                        </li>
                        <li><b class="highlight">Code Packaging and Debugging</b><br>
                          All files needed to be bundled properly for deployment. The project used ESLint for
                          JavaScript
                          linting, but resolving errors required repetitive terminal commands
                          (e.g.,<code> --fix </code>) without much
                          documentation, slowing the debugging process.
                        </li>
                        <li><b class="highlight">App Store Deployment</b><br>
                          The most significant challenge was converting the web-based MVP into a native iOS app
                          <code>.ipa</code>
                          file. This process involved translating web components into iOS-compatible code, registering
                          a
                          developer account, generating certificates, configuring deployment to Apple servers, and
                          navigating the App Store review process.

                          and deployed
                          as
                          a beta version for user testing. The product was made available through TestFlight, allowing
                          trial the application as a proof of concept.</p>
